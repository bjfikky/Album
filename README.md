#About Album

Album is a native iOS app developed using react native. It displays a list of albums supplied by an API. "Buying" the album
launches the user's browser and takes him to the url for purchasing the album on amazon.

While the app does not do a whole lot, it covers the fundamentals of developing an iOS app using React and React-Native.
